# Social Tables Intern Challlenge

Our help page <http://help.socialtables.com/> needs help! Your challenge is to write **test coverage** so tablers can sleep better at night knowing customers have access to the help they need.

## The Tests

Please add coverage for the following functionality:

1. The Social Tables logo in the top left should link to <https://www.socialtables.com/>.
2. Searching for `Bobby Fisher` should return 0 results.
3. Searching for `event` should return 10 results.
4. Searching for a word under three character should trigger an alert box with the text `Search string must be at least 3 characters long`.

All tests must run against <http://help.socialtables.com>.

For extra credit, add a test of your own.

## Requirements

* You must use [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
* You must use [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs)
* You must use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

You probably haven't used some or all of these packages before. Fear not.  We designed this challenge anticipating you would need to learn to pass. 

## How To Get Started

You are provided with boilerplate that includes a sample test with all requirements working together. 

General steps to get the boilerplate running:

* Install [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
* Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * For OS X, we prefer using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to `brew install node`
  * Make sure you are installing a version of Node that is 6.0.0 or higher
* `npm install mocha -g`
* `npm install chai -g`
* `git clone https://github.com/socialtables/intern-challenge.git`
* `cd intern-challenge`
* `npm install`
* `mocha test`

This should start the mocha test runner and selenium.  One test should pass and four should be marked as pending.  Your job is to complete the pending tests.

You are not required to use the boilerplate, but it is recommended.

## What To Turn In

Send all your files in one email to <internchallenge@socialtables.com> with the subject line, `Social Tables Intern Challenge`.

You must include the following files in your email: yourinitials-readme.{md, txt}, yourinitials-code.{tar.gz, zip}, yourinitials-resume.pdf (where yourinitials are your initials).

These files will contain:

* The yourinitials-readme.{md, txt} contains instructions for running your code and any notes you wish to include.
* The yourinitials-code.{tar.gz, zip} contains your code. You can optionally also submit a link to your code in the readme file.
* A file named yourinitials-resume.pdf containing your resume.

Submitting your node-modules folder isn't necessary, for example, because we can get it by running `npm install`; however, you should at least submit any files you found necessary to change and enough support and explanation so we can reproduce your results. In any case, include all the information in yourinitials-readme.{md, txt}.
